Middleman Test Project
======================

This project is a simple middleman implementation using haml/scss/coffeescript. It also uses some cool attempts at event handler binding, class instantiation, and templating.


Middleman + HTML5
-----------------

This project was started by first installing the middleman ruby gem

    $ gem install middleman
    
and then running

    $ middleman init my_new_boilerplate_project --template=html5

to create a new HTML5 Boilerplate project. This gives you a nice directory tree all set up for static site development.
